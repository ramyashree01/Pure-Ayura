<h1><u>Natural/Ayurvedic Home Remedies for Fever</u></h1>
<p>Fever or Jwar is one of the most comprehensively described entity in Ayurveda. Thirteen types of fever are described
    in Ayurveda - Vataja, Pittaja, Kaphaja, Vata-Pittaja, Vata- Kaphaja, Tridoshaj (intrinsic fevers), Agantuja (extrinsic fever), Kamaja (related to sex), Shokaja (anxiety induced), Vishama jwar (malaria), Krodhaja (anger induced) and Bhuta-vistha (of unknown origin). Depending upon the doshic involvement or other factors, additional symptoms besides elevation of temperature are observed. For treating malarial 
    fever you can check out the home remedies for malaria fever.</p>
<p>The causative factors of fever are diverse and hence the management is equally varied. In majority of the fevers, the presence of mind
     and common sense in handling a situation goes in conformity with the laws of nature. </p>

     You could even add the rose water to an ice-bag and use it for sponging.</p></li>
<li><p>Take about 20 fresh leaves of Holy Basil. Take a small piece of ginger and about 5 grains of black pepper. 
    Boil them together in your tea and drink the warm liquid.</p></li>
<li><p>Never attempt to force-feed a person down with fever since the body is struggling to counter the fever and food
     may only aggravate the situation (the person is likely to vomit).</p></li>
