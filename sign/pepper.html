<h1><u>Ardhavabhedaka - Peppermint oil for Migraine and Headache Relief</u></h1>
<p><h3>For peppermint oil</h3></p>
<ol>
<li> Crush or muddle fresh peppermint leaves in a glass jar with a tight lid.</li>

<li> Cover the leaves with olive or grapeseed oil. Close the jar and shake.</li>

<li> Store for three days. Strain into a bowl and discard the leaves.</li>

<li> Pack the jar with fresh leaves, pour the oil back in the jar and cover with fresh oil. Repeat until you have the desired amount.</li>
</ol>

<p>Twenty drops of the oil should be diluted with 1.5 ounces of another oil — coconut or almond, for example — before using it topically, and with water (1 cup per five to 10 drops of oil) for mouthwash. Never put essential oils directly on your skin (they can burn).</p>

<p><h3>5 ways to use peppermint oil for headaches</h3></p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Put a few drops in your bath</b></li>
<p>Taking a bath can help decrease headache intensity. Add a few drops of diluted peppermint oil to your bath to really increase the relaxation benefits. Turn the bathroom lights off and use a candle if your headache gets worse with bright lights. Try taking a bath to prevent a headache from coming on or worsening.</p>

<li> <b>Inhale peppermint oil with steam</b></li>
<p>Pour hot water into a bowl and add 3 to 7 drops of essential oil. Cover your head with a towel, close your eyes, and breathe through your nose. Do this for no more than 2 minutes. Steam inhalation can help with sinus headaches, especially if you also have symptoms of congestion.</p>

<li><b> Add it to your massage oil</b></li>
<p>Essential oils need to be diluted in a carrier oil before being applied directly to the skin. Usually, the recommended ratio is 3 to 5 drops of essential oil to 1 ounce of sweet almond oil, warmed coconut oil, or mineral oil. People with nut allergies should always avoid nut-based oils.</p>

<p>Before applying any essential oil, do an allergy test. Mix 3 to 5 drops of essential oil with 1 ounce of your favorite carrier oil. Apply the mixture to the skin of your forearm. If there is no reaction within 24 to 48 hours, the essential oil should be safe to use.</p>

<p>Dab a couple drops of your oil mixture onto your fingers and massage it onto your temples, the back of your neck, your shoulders, and your chest area. Tension headaches are often caused by muscle contractions in this part of your body.</p>

<p>ResearchTrusted Source also shows that a 30-minute massage can help relieve headache symptoms within 24 hours. To make a homemade massage oil, add a few drops of peppermint oil to an ounce of a carrier oil.</p>

<li><b> Diffuse it into the air</b></li>
<p>Use a diffuser to help diffuse the oil into the air. You can also inhale peppermint oil directly from the bottle. If the scent is too strong, add a few drops to a cloth, cotton ball, or tissue and breathe it in. Avoid incense sticks, as the smell of smoke may worsen your symptoms.</p>

<li> <b>Drink peppermint tea</b></li>
<p>Peppermint essential oil shouldn’t bet taken orally, but you can make tea using peppermint leaves. According to a 2016 study, drinking peppermint tea may help you think more clearly and feel more alert.</p>

<p>You can also try eating peppermint or menthol candy, which has been used for digestive ailments for centuries.</p>
