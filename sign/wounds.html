<p><h3>For Open Woundss</h3></p>
<p>Wounds have been described in Ayurveda as Vrana. Almost all kinds of wounds have been described, including traumatic ones . The doshic involvement in Vrana is usually tridoshaja. However, the involvement of doshas varies with the stage of Vrana. For example, if pain is a characterizing symptom, involvement is of Vata. If the Vrana is in advanced stage, the involvement of Pitta is predominant. When the infection leads to pus formation, the involvement of Kapha is noted.
